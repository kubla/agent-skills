# Fulcra Memory CLI Reference

This reference dictates the exact shell commands required to execute the `fulcra-memory` skill's operations. Ensure all CLI operations run in the agent's root workspace (`~/.openclaw/workspace`).

## 1. Discovering Recent Memory Changes

To quickly see what memory files were updated or new knowledge was added recently:

```bash
# Get a summary of files changed in the last 1 day
uv tool run fulcra-api data-updates "1 day"

# Example output:
# {
#   "data_types": {},
#   "file_changes": [
#     {
#       "full_name": "/agent/treecle/memory/knowledge/programming/python.md",
#       "uploaded_at": "2026-07-01T21:23:28.690719Z",
#       "state": "uploaded",
#       "...": "..."
#     },
#     {
#       "full_name": "/agent/treecle/memory/session/20260701-120000_setup.md",
#       "uploaded_at": "2026-07-01T21:23:28.690719Z",
#       "state": "uploaded",
#       "...": "..."
#     }
#   ]
# }
```

*Note: The `file_changes` key is a list of file metadata objects. You can extract the `full_name` from each to see the file paths. If the summary shows that specific memory files were changed, you can then read those specific files to update your context.*

## 2. Syncing Progress and OKF Files

To keep the agent's memory in sync, generate a `progress.md` summary, ensure OKF files are updated, and upload them to Fulcra.

**Step A: Create Progress Report and OKF Files**
Generate a concise markdown file summarizing the work you have recently completed and what you plan to do next. It must include OKF YAML frontmatter. Do not include internal state or chain-of-thought. Also ensure `index.md` and `log.md` are created or updated.

```bash
# Ensure you are in the workspace
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace
mkdir -p memory

# 1. Create progress.md
cat << 'EOF' > memory/progress.md
---
type: Progress Report
title: Agent Progress
---
# Recent Accomplishments
...
EOF

# 2. Update log.md
DATE=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d")
echo "## $DATE" >> memory/log.md
echo "* **Sync**: Updated progress report." >> memory/log.md

# 3. Create index.md if it doesn't exist
cat << 'EOF' > memory/index.md
# Memory Namespace

* [Progress Report](./progress.md) - The latest summary of agent activities.
* [Update Log](./log.md) - History of changes to this namespace.
EOF
```

**Step B: Upload to Fulcra**
Upload the files using the standardized agent path convention. Determine the agent's name (lowercase) to use in the path.

```bash
# Replace <agent_name> with the agent's actual name (e.g., treecle, wazir) in lowercase
uv tool run fulcra-api file upload memory/progress.md "agent/<agent_name>/progress.md"
uv tool run fulcra-api file upload memory/log.md "agent/<agent_name>/log.md"
uv tool run fulcra-api file upload memory/index.md "agent/<agent_name>/index.md"
```

**Step C: Sync Identity & Role**
If the agent's identity, duties, or standard operating procedures change, update the `role.md` file and upload it. Include OKF YAML frontmatter (`type: Role`).

```bash
uv tool run fulcra-api file upload memory/role.md "agent/<agent_name>/role.md"
```

## 2. Saving Session Summaries

When completing a spate of work or when asked to remember specific session context, generate a summary file in the `session/` directory and upload it.

**Step A: Create the Session Summary**
Generate a concise markdown file capturing the session's context, decisions, and outcomes. Include OKF YAML frontmatter (`type: Session Summary`, `date: YYYY-MM-DD`). 
- **Filename Convention:** Prefix the file with a timestamp (`YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`) followed by an underscore and a short subject (e.g., `memory/session/20260623-180530_setup-dashboard.md`).

**Step B: Upload to Fulcra**
Upload the file to the `session/` namespace using the agent's name.

```bash
uv tool run fulcra-api file upload memory/session/20260623-180530_setup-dashboard.md "agent/<agent_name>/session/20260623-180530_setup-dashboard.md"
```

## 3. Managing Long-Running Tasks

For longer-running tasks, create and periodically update a task tracking file in the `task/` directory.

**Step A: Create or Update the Task File**
Generate or update a markdown file with OKF YAML frontmatter (`type: Task`). Track the overall purpose, current state, and result of the task. Include references to any related artifacts or session summary files.
- **Filename Convention:** Name the file directly after the task (e.g., `memory/task/setup-dashboard.md`). DO NOT prefix it with a timestamp.

**Step B: Update the Task Index**
Ensure `memory/task/index.md` is updated to include a link to the new or active task file.

**Step C: Upload to Fulcra**
Upload both the task file and the task index.

uv tool run fulcra-api file upload memory/task/setup-dashboard.md "agent/<agent_name>/task/setup-dashboard.md"
uv tool run fulcra-api file upload memory/task/index.md "agent/<agent_name>/task/index.md"
```

## 4. Personal Inbox Lifecycle

Agents can receive files in their personal inbox (`inbox/`) from users or external triggers. Users can drop files here manually without needing strict timestamp formats.

**Step A: Process and Archive**
Read the file from the inbox. Once processed, you must upload it to the `archive/` directory. If the original file name doesn't start with a timestamp, you **must prepend one** (`YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_`).

```bash
# Example for a file originally named "todo.md"
uv tool run fulcra-api file upload memory/archive/20260624-153000_todo.md "agent/<agent_name>/archive/20260624-153000_todo.md"
```

**Step B: Delete from Inbox**
Once safely archived, delete the original file from the inbox.

```bash
uv tool run fulcra-api file delete "agent/<agent_name>/inbox/todo.md"
```
