# Fulcra Memory CLI Reference

This reference dictates the exact shell commands required to execute the `fulcra-memory` skill's operations. Ensure all tar and CLI operations run in the agent's root workspace (`~/.openclaw/workspace`).

## 1. Creating a Backup and Uploading

To back up the agent's memory, you must generate a `top_of_mind.md` summary, compress the core identity files, and upload both to Fulcra.

**Step A: Create Top of Mind**
Generate a concise markdown file summarizing your current tasks, thoughts, and context.
```bash
# Ensure you are in the workspace
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace
mkdir -p memory
echo "# Current Agent State..." > memory/top_of_mind.md
# (Write your actual summary content to this file)
```

**Step B: Compress the files**
```bash
# Create a gzip tarball containing the essential memory files (ignore if some are missing)
tar -czvf /tmp/memory.tar.gz SOUL.md IDENTITY.md MEMORY.md memory/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Step C: Upload to Fulcra**
Upload the files using the standardized agent path convention. Determine the agent's name (lowercase) to use in the path.

```bash
# Replace <agent_name> with the agent's actual name (e.g., treecle, wazir) in lowercase
uv tool run fulcra-api file upload /tmp/memory.tar.gz "agent/<agent_name>/memory/memory.tar.gz"
uv tool run fulcra-api file upload memory/top_of_mind.md "agent/<agent_name>/memory/top_of_mind.md"
```

## 2. Listing Memory History

Because Fulcra versions files automatically, you can see all previous backups of the memory using the `stat` command.

```bash
uv tool run fulcra-api file stat "agent/<agent_name>/memory/memory.tar.gz"
```
*(This command will output information about the file, including all previously uploaded versions and their UUIDs. Present these to the user so they can select a version to restore.)*

## 3. Safe Restoration / Rollback

**CRITICAL:** Before performing a restore, you MUST perform a fresh backup (Step 1 above) to ensure the current state isn't lost.

Once the pre-restore backup is complete, use the Fulcra CLI to set the active version, then download and extract it.

**Step A: Restore the version in Fulcra**
```bash
# Instruct Fulcra to make the older version the active file
uv tool run fulcra-api file restore <version_id>
```

**Step B: Download the restored file**
```bash
uv tool run fulcra-api file download "agent/<agent_name>/memory/memory.tar.gz" /tmp/restored_memory.tar.gz
```

**Step C: Inspect and Confirm**
**STOP.** You MUST explicitly warn the user that extracting the archive will overwrite their current identity and memory files (`SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and `memory/`). Before asking for confirmation, inspect the contents of the archive to ensure it looks safe and expected:
```bash
tar -ztvf /tmp/restored_memory.tar.gz
```
Share the list of files with the user and ask for their explicit confirmation before proceeding.

**Step D: Extract and overwrite local memory**
```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace
tar -xzvf /tmp/restored_memory.tar.gz
```
*(This will overwrite the local `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and the `memory/` directory with the state from the downloaded archive.)*

## 4. Cloning Another Agent's Memory

To clone, skip the restore step and simply download the target agent's `memory.tar.gz` archive.

```bash
# Download the target agent's memory
uv tool run fulcra-api file download "agent/<other_agent_name>/memory/memory.tar.gz" /tmp/restored_memory.tar.gz
```

**STOP.** You MUST explicitly warn the user that extracting the cloned archive will overwrite your current identity and memory files with the cloned agent's state. Before asking for confirmation, inspect the contents of the cloned archive:
```bash
tar -ztvf /tmp/restored_memory.tar.gz
```
Share the list of files with the user and ask for their explicit confirmation before proceeding.

```bash
# Extract locally (Only after user confirmation!)
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace
tar -xzvf /tmp/restored_memory.tar.gz
```

## 5. Uploading User Artifacts

When an agent generates a file (like an HTML dashboard, an image, or a report), and the user explicitly approves saving it to their Fulcra account, upload it to the `artifacts/` subdirectory.

```bash
# Replace <agent_name> with the agent's name, and <artifact_name> with the file's name
uv tool run fulcra-api file upload /path/to/local/file "agent/<agent_name>/artifacts/<artifact_name>"
```

## 6. Team Coordination (Inbox & Archive)

Agents can coordinate by writing to and reading from team namespaces.

**Step A: Sending a message to a teammate's inbox**
```bash
# Upload a local markdown file to the target agent's inbox
uv tool run fulcra-api file upload /tmp/task-for-wazir.md "team/<team_name>/<target_agent_name>/inbox/task_123.md"
```

**Step B: Checking your inbox**
```bash
# List files in your agent's inbox
uv tool run fulcra-api file list "team/<team_name>/<your_agent_name>/inbox/"
```

**Step C: Processing and Archiving a message**
Once you have downloaded and read a message from your inbox, move it to the archive.

```bash
# 1. Download to read (if you haven't already)
uv tool run fulcra-api file download "team/<team_name>/<your_agent_name>/inbox/task_123.md" /tmp/task_123.md

# 2. Upload it to your archive directory
uv tool run fulcra-api file upload /tmp/task_123.md "team/<team_name>/<your_agent_name>/archive/task_123.md"

# 3. Verify archival succeeded before deletion!
uv tool run fulcra-api file stat "team/<team_name>/<your_agent_name>/archive/task_123.md"

# 4. Delete it from the inbox to clear it (only if step 3 succeeded)
uv tool run fulcra-api file delete "team/<team_name>/<your_agent_name>/inbox/task_123.md"
```
