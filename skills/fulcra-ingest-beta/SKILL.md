# Fulcra Ingest Beta

This skill establishes a Librarian-Worker agent pattern to asynchronously process 3rd-party data exports that the user has uploaded to their Fulcra File Store. It profiles the data schemas, creates idempotent Fulcra Annotation mappings, and ingests the data points.

## General Guidelines

- **Zero User Friction:** Assume the user has dumped a raw ZIP/JSON/CSV into their Fulcra `ingest`. Do not ask them to map schemas manually unless absolutely necessary for a completely unrecognized format.
- **Proactive Automation:** Proactively ask the user if they would like to set up a cron job, a continuous loop, or a heartbeat reminder (depending on what is appropriate for the running agent) to periodically check the `ingest/` directory for new files or to automatically fetch data from APIs and other sources it can pull directly.
- **File Filtering:** The Librarian must strictly ignore the `_meta/` subdirectory and any `.md` files found in the `ingest` root to prevent attempting to ingest the agent's own OKF tracking files.
- **Idempotency:** Never create duplicate schemas. Always use the annotation's `description` field to store the specific namespace (e.g., `com.fulcradynamics.annotation.ingest.spotify`) and check the `catalog` first.
- **Data Correction:** If the user requests to correct ingested data (e.g., they want to change the tagging scheme), you must delete the old records via `DeletedRecord` payloads and then re-ingest the data (you can reuse the original record IDs). You can re-import the previously archived file from `ingest/_meta/archive/artifact/` to process the new tags. See the references for instructions.
- **Coordination:** Use `delegate_task` to dispatch specific files to a Worker subagent so the primary thread isn't blocked.


## References
- **`references/fulcra-ingest-cli.md`**: Contains the necessary `fulcra-api` CLI commands for checking the catalog, listing files, and creating new data types.
- **`references/fulcra-ingest-record-annotations.md`**: Provides the exact POST endpoint, authentication headers, JSON schemas, and **tagging instructions** required for ingesting records to Fulcra Annotations.
- **`references/fulcra-ingest-source-mapping.md`**: Outlines the structure and workflow for maintaining the `ingest/_meta/source_map.md` file, which tracks data lineage, prevents duplicate schemas, handles ingest versioning, and logs archived files.
- **`scripts/generate_deterministic_id.py`**: A python script that takes arbitrary string arguments and returns a consistent, deterministic UUID. Use this to ensure idempotency across ingested records.

## The Pipeline

0. **The Fetcher (API/CLI Extraction)** *(If applicable)*
   - **Proactive Notification:** When interacting with a new user or if no file has been uploaded yet, politely inform them of this capability: let them know you can process manual file uploads OR automatically extract data from accessible APIs, local services, and CLI tools (like GitHub) on their behalf. You can also provide them with the direct link to the `ingest` directory in the Fulcra web dashboard (https://context.fulcradynamics.com/library/files/ingest) so they can easily drop files there if it's more convenient.
   - If the user requests to ingest data from an API, CLI tool, or local service rather than pointing to a pre-uploaded file, first fetch the data programmatically.
   - Save the fetched data to a structured file (e.g., CSV or JSON) in the local workspace.
   - Upload the file to the Fulcra File Store drop-zone using `uvx fulcra-api file upload <local_file> ingest/<filename>`.
   - Once uploaded, proceed with the standard Librarian triage process below.

1. **The Librarian (Triage)**
   - Use `uvx fulcra-api file list` to check the `ingest/` directory. Explicitly ignore the `_meta/` folder and any `.md` files.
   - If new data files are found, use `delegate_task` to spin up a Worker subagent and pass the `file_id` and identified service as context.

2. **The Worker (Profiling & Ingestion)**
   - **Retrieval:** Execute `uvx fulcra-api file download <file_id> ./<filename>`.
   - **Source Mapping & Schema Resolution:** **Crucial:** You must strictly follow the agent workflow outlined in `references/fulcra-ingest-source-mapping.md`. Rely on the `source_map.md` registry to resolve the target schema ID. If you need to create a new schema for an unseen source, consult `references/fulcra-ingest-cli.md` for the correct CLI commands and base types.
   - **Data Ingestion:** Write and execute a Python script to parse the file. 
     - Generate deterministic UUIDs for `metadata.id` using `scripts/generate_deterministic_id.py` (ensure you pass the source identifier followed by the specific ID fields to prevent cross-service collisions).
     - Construct the payload and push the records via POST to `/ingest/v1/record` exactly as specified in `references/fulcra-ingest-record-annotations.md`.

3. **Cleanup & Archive**
   - Archive the processed file by explicitly downloading it from `ingest/` and re-uploading it to `ingest/_meta/archive/artifact/`. **When archiving, prefix the filename with a timestamp in the format `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`**.
   - Example commands:
     - `uvx fulcra-api file download ingest/NetflixViewingHistory.csv ./NetflixViewingHistory.csv` (if not already downloaded)
     - `uvx fulcra-api file upload ./NetflixViewingHistory.csv ingest/_meta/archive/artifact/20260625-143000_NetflixViewingHistory.csv`
   - **CRITICAL SAFETY CHECK:** Before deleting the original file, you MUST verify that the file was successfully uploaded to the archive path (e.g., `uvx fulcra-api file list ingest/_meta/archive/artifact/` or `uvx fulcra-api file stat ingest/_meta/archive/artifact/20260625-143000_NetflixViewingHistory.csv`). Do not delete the original data unless you have confirmed the archive copy exists.
   - Only after verifying the archived file exists, delete the original file from the `ingest/` directory (e.g., `uvx fulcra-api file delete ingest/NetflixViewingHistory.csv`).
   - Finalize the process by updating the `source_map.md` in memory and uploading it back to Fulcra, as instructed in the source mapping reference.
   - **User Handoff:** If the user is present or asked about the ingestion directly, inform them that their data is being processed and point them to `https://context.fulcradynamics.com/timeline?mode=week&date=YYYY-MM-DD` to view their new data, where `YYYY-MM-DD` is calculated as six days *before* the latest `recorded_at` value in the ingested dataset (this ensures the week view includes the newest data point). Mention that for large datasets, it may take a little time for all records to fully appear on the timeline. Remind the user that if they ever want to change the tagging scheme or fix a mistake, they can simply ask you to correct the data and you will automatically handle the deletion and re-ingestion.
