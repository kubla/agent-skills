# Fulcra Ingest Beta

This skill establishes a Librarian-Worker agent pattern to asynchronously process 3rd-party data exports that the user has uploaded to their Fulcra File Store. It profiles the data schemas, creates idempotent Fulcra Annotation mappings, and ingests the data points.

## General Guidelines

- **Zero User Friction:** Assume the user has dumped a raw ZIP/JSON/CSV into their Fulcra `ingest`. Do not ask them to map schemas manually unless absolutely necessary for a completely unrecognized format.
- **File Filtering:** The Librarian must strictly ignore the `_meta/` subdirectory and any `.md` files found in the `ingest` root to prevent attempting to ingest the agent's own OKF tracking files.
- **Idempotency:** Never create duplicate schemas. Always use the annotation's `description` field to store the specific namespace (e.g., `com.fulcradynamics.annotation.ingest.spotify`) and check the `catalog` first.
- **Coordination:** Use `delegate_task` to dispatch specific files to a Worker subagent so the primary thread isn't blocked.


## References
- **`references/fulcra-ingest-cli.md`**: Contains the necessary `fulcra-api` CLI commands for checking the catalog, listing files, and creating new data types.
- **`references/fulcra-ingest-record-annotations.md`**: Provides the exact POST endpoint, authentication headers, and JSON schemas required for ingesting records to Fulcra Annotations.

- **`references/fulcra-ingest-source-mapping.md`**: Outlines the structure and workflow for maintaining the `ingest/_meta/source_map.md` file, which tracks data lineage, prevents duplicate schemas, and logs archived files.

- **`scripts/generate_deterministic_id.py`**: A python script that takes arbitrary string arguments and returns a consistent, deterministic UUID. Use this to ensure idempotency across ingested records.

## The Pipeline

1. **The Librarian (Triage)**
   - Use `uvx fulcra-api file list` to check the `ingest/` directory. Explicitly ignore the `_meta/` folder and any `.md` files.
   - If new data files are found, use `delegate_task` to spin up a Worker subagent and pass the `file_id` and identified service as context.

2. **The Worker (Profiling & Ingestion)**
   - **Download:** Execute `uvx fulcra-api file download <file_id> ./<filename>`.
   - **Profile Schema:** Read the first few lines/objects to determine the data shape. Pick the most appropriate Fulcra Annotation primitive (`DurationAnnotation`, `NumericAnnotation`, `MomentAnnotation`, etc.).
   - **Source Map Lookup:** Download and read `ingest/_meta/source_map.md` (initialize if missing). Look up the detected source (e.g., `com.netflix`). If found, extract the mapped Annotation ID and verify the type matches. If not found, fall back to checking `uvx fulcra-api catalog`.
   - **Schema Registration:** If no schema exists in the map or catalog, run `uvx fulcra-api data-type create <Primitive> "<Service Name> Export" -d "<namespace>"`. Save the resulting `fulcra_source_id`.
   - **Data Ingestion:** Write and execute a Python script to iterate through the data. For each record, map the fields into the Fulcra schema payload. **Crucial:** Extract the specific fields defined in the Source Map's `Deterministic ID Fields` property, and pass them to `scripts/generate_deterministic_id.py` (or import it) to generate the UUID. Assign this UUID to the `metadata.id` field of the payload to prevent duplicates across multiple uploads.
   - **Post Data:** Use `POST https://api.fulcradynamics.com/ingest/v1/record` with the user's auth token.

3. **Cleanup**
   - Once the worker completes, log the ingestion summary.
   - Archive the file by moving it from the `ingest/` directory to the `ingest/_meta/archive/artifact/` directory in the Fulcra file store. **When archiving, prefix the filename with a timestamp in the format `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`** (e.g., `ingest/_meta/archive/artifact/20260625-143000_NetflixViewingHistory.csv`).
   - **Update Source Map:** Update `source_map.md` with the new `archived_locations` path and annotation details, then upload it back to `ingest/_meta/source_map.md`.
