# Fulcra Dashboard

This skill provides the automated setup for a lightweight, build-less web dashboard. It relies entirely on **Alpine.js** for state management and **Vanilla CSS** for styling. It eschews complex frameworks (like SvelteKit) and utility-class libraries in favor of a "Single-Scroll Artifact" or a "Static Triad" that is instantly deployable to simple hosts like GitHub Pages without any build tools or Content Security Policy conflicts.

## Architecture Decrees

When constructing this dashboard, you **MUST** follow these strict architectural rules to prevent the file from becoming a tangled, unmaintainable monolith:

1. **Monumental Landmarks (Banner Comments):** Divide the HTML file into distinct provinces using highly visible comments. This ensures you (the agent) can navigate and edit surgical blocks safely.
   ```html
   <!-- ========================================== -->
   <!-- 🏛️ PROVINCE: DASHBOARD LAYOUT & UI         -->
   <!-- ========================================== -->
   <main> ... </main>

   <!-- ========================================== -->
   <!-- 🧠 PROVINCE: ALPINE.JS STATE & LOGIC       -->
   <!-- ========================================== -->
   <script> ... </script>

   <!-- ========================================== -->
   <!-- 🎨 PROVINCE: D3.js VISUALIZATIONS          -->
   <!-- ========================================== -->
   <script> ... </script>
   ```

2. **The Separation of Domains:** Do not write massive inline Alpine logic (e.g., `x-data="{ huge object }"`). You must use `Alpine.data()` within the "Alpine.js State & Logic" province to extract the logic into a clean script block. The HTML should only contain the bindings (`x-data="dashboard()"`, `x-text`, `x-show`, etc.).

3. **The Static Triad (Escape Hatch):** While a single `index.html` is preferred, if the dashboard grows too vast, you may split it into three files:
   - `index.html` (Structure & Semantic HTML)
   - `app.js` (Alpine `Alpine.data()` and D3 functions)
   - `styles.css` (Custom overriding aesthetics)
   No build step is allowed.

## Usage

When a user requests to "set up the web app" or "create a dashboard for the Fulcra skills", you should execute the setup script provided by this skill. 

```bash
# Run the setup script to scaffold the Alpine dashboard
./scripts/setup-dashboard.sh <target-directory>
```

If no `<target-directory>` is provided, it defaults to creating a `fulcra-dashboard` folder in the current working directory.

## Workflow

1. **Scaffold:** The script copies a clean, un-styled Alpine.js dashboard template (which includes the HTML, Python server, and external CSS) into the target directory.
2. **Data Ingestion (Requires Consent):** Automatically fetch the user's relevant Fulcra data using the `fulcra-api` CLI. 
   - **Important:** Always ask the user for permission to query the Fulcra API to build the dashboard before fetching records.
   - Run `uv tool run fulcra-api catalog` to discover available data. **CRITICAL:** Prioritize user-configured data over passive metrics (like step count). Explicitly filter for items where `categories` includes `"user_configured"`, or where the `id` follows the format `*Annotation/<UUID>` (e.g., `ScaleAnnotation/1234-abcd...`).
   - Fetch records for the user's custom annotations (e.g., `uv tool run fulcra-api get-records "ScaleAnnotation/<UUID>" "30 days" > timeline_name.jsonl`) as well as the `RecordsProcessed` metric. Keep the files as raw JSONL in the dashboard directory.
   - The `data.json` config file acts as a manifest. It should map your layout to the `.jsonl` files you downloaded, like this: `{"timelines": [{"id": "...", "title": "...", "icon": "...", "color": "...", "data": "timeline_name.jsonl"}], "recordsProcessed": "records_processed.jsonl"}`. 
   - You do not need to write an aggregation script; the dashboard will automatically parse `.jsonl` files and aggregate records for the charts natively on `init()`.
3. **Theming & Visualization:**
   - **Theme Discovery:** Ask the user what "theme" or "vibe" they want (e.g., minimalist dark mode, cyberpunk, a retro diner, a space station, a cozy bakery). 
   - **Embrace the Theme (HTML & Copy):** Do not leave default boilerplate intact! Modify `index.html` directly to rewrite the main title, subtitle, and chart headers to fit the theme (e.g., change "Fulcra Dashboard" to "The Cybernetic Core" or "Records Processed" to "Baguettes Baked"). Replace all default emojis (like 📊 or 🛰️) with theme-appropriate icons. You may alter the HTML structure to add new thematic containers or elements.
   - **Apply the Theme (CSS):** Heavily edit the `theme.css` file to apply the aesthetic. Apply custom backgrounds, fonts, borders, box-shadows, and CSS variables directly to the semantic classes (e.g., `.hero-header`, `.dashboard-title`).
   - **Original Art (Required):** Generate one piece of highly creative thematic art using the `image_generate` tool. Save it to the folder and reference it via an `<img>` tag in the dashboard header. **Style Directive:** The image should be a highly polished, high-resolution, abstract 3D asset (similar in quality, depth, and sleekness to the svelte.dev hero art). However, **you must strictly adapt the colors, lighting, and geometric elements to match the user's chosen theme and the CSS variables you are writing.** Do not just copy the orange/red Svelte colors unless it actually fits the requested vibe.
   - **Dynamic Animated Elements:** Inject at least one CSS animation (using standard CSS `@keyframes` in `theme.css`) that fits the theme (e.g., a floating asteroid, a blinking cursor, a buzzing fly) and attach it to the `.animation-layer` or other suitable elements.
4. **Git Repository Initialization:**
   - Once scaffolded, **you MUST prompt the user to initialize a git repository**.
   - Check if `git` is installed. Suggest 1 or 2 fun repository names.
   - Initialize locally (`git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"`). *Do not push to GitHub during the initial onboarding flow unless explicitly requested.*
5. **Run & Verify:**
   - Start the local Python server to preview the dashboard:
     ```bash
     cd <target-directory>
     python3 server.py 8081 > dev.log 2>&1 &
     ```
   - Provide the user with the localhost link.
6. **Chat Envoy & GitHub Deployment:** 
   - The dashboard includes a "Sub-Surface Relay" chat envoy. Remind the user that this envoy only functions locally via the Python server.
   - If the user pushes the repository to GitHub Pages, the CSS is designed to automatically hide the envoy to prevent user confusion, as the chat interface cannot route messages to the local Python bridge from a remote host.
