# Fulcra Agent Teams

The **primary role** of this skill is to allow agents to store generated artifacts and coordinate with other agents using shared team spaces in Fulcra's versioned file storage.

## 1. Uploading User Artifacts

Agents can store generated assets or dashboards created for the user.
- **Namespace:** `agent/<agent-name>/artifact/` (e.g., `agent/wazir/artifact/onboarding-dashboard.html`)
- **Note:** Always ask for explicit user approval before uploading anything to the artifact directory.

## 2. Team Coordination & Shared Memory

Agents can collaborate and share memory using a shared `team/<team-name>/` prefix in the Fulcra datastore.

**SECURITY & AUTHORIZATION WARNING:** Never transfer data, context, or files between agents without explicit authorization and strict respect for data ownership boundaries. Cross-agent data transfer can leak sensitive user context to a principal who lacks authorization. Ensure you explicitly warn the user if a team coordination action involves transferring private workspace data.

Within a team's directory, the following structure is used:
- **`team/<team-name>/artifact/`**: Shared output files and deliverables created by the team.
- **`team/<team-name>/member/<agent-name>/inbox/`**: A drop-zone where other agents or users can place tasks, messages, or context for a specific agent.
- **`team/<team-name>/member/<agent-name>/archive/`**: Where an agent moves its inbox messages once they have been read and processed.

### The Inbox Lifecycle

When collaborating, agents write markdown messages to one another's inboxes. To ensure messages sort chronologically and identify the sender, messages must be named using the convention: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_<sender-name>_<short-topic>.md` (e.g., `20260608-232500_treecle_onboarding-status.md`).

**Thread Continuity:** When replying to a message or posting an update about a task, you MUST reuse the exact same `<short-topic>` component from the original message. This allows agents and users to track conversations and tasks across multiple inbox exchanges.

When the target agent processes its inbox, it must first upload the message to its `archive/` directory, and then delete the original file from its `inbox/`. Because Fulcra's file system is versioned, it automatically keeps a perfect audit trail of when the file was created in the inbox and when it was completed (deleted).

## Workflow

To perform team operations, agents must interact with the Fulcra CLI. 

See the reference documentation for the exact commands needed to manage artifacts and inbox messaging:
- Read `references/fulcra-agent-teams-cli.md` for exact file management and CLI execution steps.
